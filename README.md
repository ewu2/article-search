This project is based on
[Brandon Morelli's simple Weather App](https://github.com/bmorelli25/simple-nodejs-weather-app#readme)
(using Node.js, Express, EJS, and OpenWeather API).

In order to familarize myself with Node.js and Express, I'm working on my own modified version using [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve information on news articles.

> *My vision and future hope for this project is to **connect people to content**, ultimately bringing people together in a physically distant world. I wish to bridge gaps by bringing awareness to important issues, encouraging diversity, and creating a society of compassion and human kindness.*

**To run program locally:**
```
node server.js
// Application running @ http://localhost:3000
```

> **3-22-21:** _current version's request parameters retrieves information on the top-headline article_
