This project is based on
[Brandon Morelli's simple Weather App](https://github.com/bmorelli25/simple-nodejs-weather-app#readme)
(using Node.js, Express, EJS, and OpenWeather API).

In order to familarize myself with Node.js and Express, I'm working on my own modified version using [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to retrieve information on news articles.

To run program locally:
```
node server.js
// Application running @ http://localhost:3000
```

> **3-22-21:** _current version's request parameters retrieves information on the top-headline article in the US_
